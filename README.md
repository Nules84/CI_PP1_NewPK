## Project Goals 

A comprehensive website for a traditional portrait artist based in Ireland. The website features a promotional video, testimonials, a gallery of the artist's work, an about page, pricing tables, a clear step-by-step guide to ordering and a contact page. The primary goal of the website is to lead potential customers to making first contact with the artist via the contact page.

An important note on the longer path to buy is that unlike most B2C websites - which are emotion driven to impulse buy and have the fewest number of steps to the point of purchase - ordering a custom piece of art is an expensive and significant purchase, and one that comes with the need for more information than the average B2C purchase. This website tries to address the needs of the customer to find all the information that they need to make a decision to contact the artist, while breaking the information up into small easy to understand sections, and making the steps to the point of contact as clear and easy to follow as possible.

The business goals of this website are:

   * Build brand awareness.
   *  Provide high quality examples of the artist's drawings and paintings.
   *  Drive sales in the form of first contact (via the contact page) that will then lead to a sales call with the artist.
   *  Excellent UX to keep potential clients on site long enough to fill out the contact form.

The customer goals of this website are:

   *  Searching for high quality, bespoke artwork for their home or treasured gift.
   * Clear easy to find pricing.
   *  Intuitive ordering process.

## Design

### Design Choices
The webpage was designed with the feeling a customer might get while dining at the restaurant. It is calm, warm and inviting. 
Some of the imagery on the page has a round shape with a border to resemble food served on a plate.

### Colour
For the colour sheme warm blue tones were chosen to match the images on the page and also the colour theme of the sea side where Padraic grew up. To narrow down the colours I used Adobe Color. After deciding on the colour I tested them on WebAIM to make sure the contrast between them was right.
<br>

![color](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95381506/150836380-781b5a3e-9011-4873-b698-ab09038b4691.JPG)

### Fonts
Pinyon script with cursive as fallback was used for the logo to match the sign outside the restaurant. 
<br>
Montserrat was used for the body and Roboto for headings. Both fonts are considered dyslexia friendly.

### Structure
The page is structured in a well know, recognizable, user friendly, and easy to learn way. Upon arriving to the website the user sees a familiar type of navigation bar with the restaurant logo on the left side and the navigation links to the right. 
The website consists of five separate pages: 
- A homepage with a sections for News and Sunday Meal Offers
- An about page with the About Us and Meet the Chef
- A menu page
- A image gallery with images and video showcasing the general feel of the restaurant
- A contact page with a contact form, a map and information about the bussines section

## UX

Ideal client
The ideal client for this business is:

   *  English speaking.
   *  Has disposable income.
   *  Can be anywhere in the world.

Visitors to this website are searching for:

   *  An artist to create a commissioned painting to decorate their home.
    And/or a bespoke gift.

This project is the best way to help them achieve these things because:

   *  Most artists' websites have very poor UX.
    Other artists' websites are over complicated and produce information overload quickly.
    This website is:
       *  Easy to navigate.
       *  Steps the client through easy to understand learnable information.
       *  Gives the client the information they need without overloading them.
       *  Guiding them to the goal of the website - to fill out the contact form.

User stories

   *  As a new visitor to the website, I want to easily navigate the site, so I can find what I need efficiently.
   *  As a new visitor to the website, I want view this artist's gallery, and view their work in detail so I can decide if I want to commission their work.
   *  As a new visitor to the website, I want learn more about the artist, so I can feel I connect with him as a person.
   *  As a potential client, I want to know what past clients thought of their artwork and the service they received.
   *  As a potential client, I want to view expected prices for a portrait, so I can decide if it is within my budget to order.
   *  As an interested client, I want to understand the ordering process, so I know what steps to take next.
   *  As an interested client, I want an easy to fill in contact form, so I can make contact with the artist and place my order.
   *  As an interested observer and/or potential client, I want to follow the artist on social media, so I can keep up with her latest news.
   *  As a returning visitor to the website, who has already decided to contact the artist, I want to be able to find out where the artist is geographically so that I might pick up my commission if required.

- __Commission and Pricing Section__

  - The Commissions and Pricing section will allow the user to see the commission services provided by the artist and how much it would cost for the service. 
  - By making the buying process simple and explicit as possible, this should encourage the user to consider contacting us for their first commission.

  - Below teh testimonial I have included a news section which will be updated at intervals. This section will update the user on the current activities of the artist, adding further value as it gives an impression of current and future project investments.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95381506/150646317-6826c230-05a0-46f3-85eb-bc7885977965.png)

I have included a google map of the Artists geographic location, should clients in the area wish to know the locality of the studio. I have purposefully made the artists specific address and location vague, as the artist has requested that his personal details and home address remain anonymous. 

### Features Left to Implement

In future, I would like to include:
- A downward arrow over the bottom centre of the Hero Image carousel to help leed the users scroll toward the content which continues further down the page. 
- An Archive Tab for Sold and Archived paintings.
- A page for print sales.

### Performing tests on various devices 
The website was tested on the following devices:
- Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro (both in pc and tablet mode)
- Honor 20 pro
- Xiaomi Redmi Note 7
  
### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
