# Padraic King

A comprehensive website for a traditional portrait artist based in Ireland. The website features a promotional video, testimonials, a gallery of the artist's work, an about page, pricing tables, a clear step-by-step guide to ordering and a contact page. The primary goal of the website is to lead potential customers to making first contact with the artist via the contact page.

An important note on the longer path to buy is that unlike most B2C websites - which are emotion driven to impulse buy and have the fewest number of steps to the point of purchase - ordering a custom portrait is an expensive and significant purchase, and one that comes with the need for more information than the average B2C purchase. This website tries to address the needs of the customer to find all the information that they need to make a decision to contact the artist, while breaking the information up into small easy to understand sections, and making the steps to the point of contact as clear and easy to follow as possible.

The business goals of this website are:

   * Build brand awareness.
   *  Provide high quality examples of the artist's drawings and paintings.
   *  Drive sales in the form of first contact (via the contact page) that will then lead to a sales call with the artist.
   *  Excellent UX to keep potential clients on site long enough to fill out the contact form.

The customer goals of this website are:

   *  Searching for high quality, bespoke artwork for their home or treasured gift.
   * Clear easy to find pricing.
   *  Intuitive ordering process.

## UX

Ideal client
The ideal client for this business is:

   *  English speaking.
   *  Has disposable income.
   *  Can be anywhere in the world.

Visitors to this website are searching for:

   *  An artist to create a commissioned painting to decorate their home.
    And/or a bespoke gift.

This project is the best way to help them achieve these things because:

   *  Most artists' websites have very poor UX.
    Other artists' websites are over complicated and produce information overload quickly.
    This website is:
       *  Easy to navigate.
       *  Steps the client through easy to understand learnable information.
       *  Gives the client the information they need without overloading them.
       *  Guiding them to the goal of the website - to fill out the contact form.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
