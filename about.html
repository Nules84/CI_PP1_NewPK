                    <h2>About the Artist</h2>
                    <p>Growing up in the idyllic village of Ardmore county Waterford, Padraic was surrounded with stunning views of the sea and historic village life which greatly features in his work. Having developed a love of painting the scenes of his native Ardmore, Padraicthen attended the National College of Art, Dublin where he completed his degree in textile art. 
                        There he developed his own personal style of painting which is unique to him. For many years has contributed his work to the Ardmore Pottery 
                        which is a stockist of his work. Padraic currently practices in the very lovely countryside of North Tipperary, 
                        near to the mythical Knockshigowna Hill and the historic Georgian town of Birr.
                        Padraics commissions are most notably of landscapes, boats and vernactular architecture.

                <p>Moving to a new home, I wanted to take some memories with me, so I enquired with Padraic if he could do a commission painting of the home I grew up in. He was so easy to work with and listened to all of my requirements.
                    I absolutely love the final product which was a gift to myself for my Birthday. It brings back so many memories and Padraic's very unique style of painting really adds so much character to the painting.
